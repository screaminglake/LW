# 2.0 - Massive Overhaul and New Metro Profile!

## Major Updates

Addition of an entirely new profile inspired by the Metro series.  The website documentation for Lost World has been significantly revamped to reflect this so read through carefully.  Since the Metro profile is brand new there are no changes to log, but here is a list of significant ways the Metro profile varies from the STALKER profile:

-Metro profile is generally more FPS intensive than the STALKER profile due to NAC X

-Greater focus on eurojank/makeshift weapons in the Metro profile

-GMOW is using the survival preset by default instead of medium (precipitation weather only) after you apply the mcm settings preset so expect to have to put on a mask as soon as you apply the preset and always need to wear one.  Being outdoors is a luxury and NPC's should always be wearing masks

-Combat is generally less harsh with slower time to kill and no player bleeding or lethal headshots on the Metro profile

-Slightly less harsh survival/needs settings on the Metro profile

-Generally more enemies and more lethal enemies in the Metro profile

-More forgiving loot drop/chances in the Metro profile

Below is a list of big changes to the existing STALKER profile for 2.0:

-open city mods added (lexington, hagen, and concord generally should have more buildings open to explore) <br />

-opened subway tunnels previously blocked.  There should be no blocked station entrances <br />

-gunner armor expansion (new gunner faction overhaul) added <br />

-loot logic and reduction added (very harsh and unforgiving loot drop and chances now) <br />

-true perks (with yuba perk patch overhaul; no more VATS perks.  Perks custom-tailored to mods being used in LW).  Thanks YungBantz! <br />

-visual overhaul with ENB and weathers <br />

-removed some armor and weapon crafting recipes from universal workbench (also you can only craft weapons with the workshop version of the universal  workbench now; not the mobile version) <br />

-can't scrap most things in workshop mode and limited item creation <br />

-clothing overhaul to most NPC's <br />

-completely remixed weapon replacements <br />

-removed PB 2000A (back to arm-mounted) <br />

# 1.6.6

# 1.6.5

## Major Updates

  -Corrections to combat overhaul introduced in 1.6.  Increased bullet speeds.  Uncovered a fatal flaw with Game Configuration Menu not saving its damage settings properly which may have led to some users not dealing as much damage as they should.  This is now corrected. <br />
  
  -Introduction of "Generic Whispers", a plugin created in-house by our very own Sweet6Shooter for Whispering Chills now adapted to rework core elements of Lost World. Major changes include the removal of stealth boys, syringers, combined meds, and bobbleheads both placed and in levelled lists; and renaming of some NPC's, armor, ingestibles, and other items to reflect the real world instead of being bound to the Fallout universe hopefully increasing the immersive realism of a STALKER experience.  Also includes overall loot reduction and crafting/workshop mode scrapping restrictions <br />
  
  -Raiders overhauled using Boston Bandits instead of MW Krueger.  More scruffy street raiders with less valuable equipment to prevent the player from becoming OP early on <br />
  
  -Full item sorting/tagging using FallUI Icon Library/Sorter plus Complex Sorter which now includes full ECO workbench integration <br />
  
  -Audio overhaul update with the addition of Ambient Tunnels of Boston and a major update to LOST Audio Tweaks and its patches to provide an overall more immersive and consistent soundscape both indoors and outdoors <br />
  
  -Reworked Modern Weapons Replacers for even more weapon diversity alongside the addition of the Mossberg 500 pump-action shotgun and AKM Complex.  Also added Bullet Counted Reload with appropriate patches <br />
  
  -Reduced amount of loot and items in starting chest behind player home <br />
  
  -Patched Polluted Climate weathers over to The Zone worldspace for a more consistent visual experience <br />

Time to kill both ways is roughly the same as before but with some added leniency toward the player that will have more to deal with in terms of injuries and penalties.
