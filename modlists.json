    "description": "Lost World is an experience featuring TWO profiles:  one that offers a STALKER-inspired hardcore survival overhaul for Fallout 4 and another that offers a Metro-inspired hardcore survival overhaul for Fallout 4.  After installing, you will be able to switch between both as you please.  Both profiles feature unique visuals, gameplay systems, soundscapes, and a completely reworked foundation that will make it feel like you are basically playing an entirely new game set in the world of Fallout 4.  Vanilla quests are still playable, though they are not tested and are not the focus of Lost World.  In Lost World, you are alone and must live off the land to survive while taking in harsh, gritty, breathtaking visuals and facing unforgiving combat.",
